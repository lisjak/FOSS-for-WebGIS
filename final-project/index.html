              Harrie Teunissen, a Dutch map collector/curator and "forerunner in
              the upcoming field of contemporary map research," characterizes
              the Holocaust as "largely a spatial history."
            </b>
            He quotes Elie Wiesel as stating, "The Nazis' aim was to make the
            Jewish universe shrink" and elaborates that "this aim required a
            process of reducing multiple and often mixed spheres of identity to
            [binary] Jewish versus non-Jewish spaces."
            <a href="#citations">[2]</a> As such, it comes with little surprise
            that "housing and Jewish persecution were increasingly intertwined"
            during German occupation. <a href="#citations">[3]</a> In "Housing,
            Hiding and the Holocaust", authors T√∂nsmeyer and von Puttkamer note
            "that accommodation became a scarce commodity [alongside] collapsing
            housing markets in [occupied countries such as] France, the
            Netherlands, Norway and Poland," the latter of which is the focus of
            this mapping project. War damage and building requisitions by
            occupying Germans further exacerbated poor and cramped housing
            conditions. <br /><br />
            <b>
              However, it was the Jewish population that was "worst hit by
              housing restrictions, even prior to ghettoization."
            </b>
            Abandoned apartments formerly belonging to fleeing Jewish residents
            were looted and appropriated by local non-Jewish populations and
            German occupiers. Pressures on housing conditions exerted by German
            war-time occupation "accelerated the marginalization and exclusion
            of local Jewish populations" by both occupiers and other occupied
            peoples. Under imposed hierarchies, those living under occupation
            improvised "their own moral economies" that were significantly
            influenced by housing insecurity and the desire for property
            ownership. <a href="#citations">[4]</a> <br /><br />
            <b>
              Eventual ghettoization enacted by German occupiers was a pivotal
              step step in the Nazi process of brutally separating, persecuting,
              murdering, and ultimately further displacing much of Europe's
              Jewish population.
            </b>
            The largest ghetto established by Nazis was the Warsaw Ghetto in
            occupied Poland, which this project focuses on. In Warsaw, more than
            400,000 Jews were crowded into an area of 1.3 square miles of
            abysmal housing conditions. Near the end of the war, ghettos served
            as deportation hubs to labor and extermination camps.
            <a href="#citations">[5]</a>

          <h2>Connecting Them to The Present</h2>
          <h4>
            <span class="quote">‚Äú</span>
            <span>
              The identity of Warsaw is built on two things: resistance during
              the war and rebuilding after the war. Warsaw was supposed to be
              the phoenix from the ashes, but they took it from us, they
              privatised it, and they told us this effort was worth nothing.

          <p>
            <b>
              By the end of the war, 90% of Warsaw had been obliterated by
              German mass bombings, heavy artillery fire, and planned demolition
              campaigns as well as other structural damage inflicted by Allies.
            </b>
            <a href="#citations">[7]</a> Throughout the course of the war, 40 to
            60 million people became homeless or displaced in Europe.
            <a href="#citations">[8]</a> Soviet control immediately followed.
            Poland‚Äôs new communist authorities issued the Bierut Decree which
            "facilitated the city‚Äôs reconstruction [by transferring] ownership
            of all land within the city‚Äôs prewar borders to the municipal
            authorities." <br /><br />
            <b
              >Since the fall of communism, Warsaw city authorities have been
              "flooded with thousands of claims ‚Äì both bogus and legitimate ‚Äì
              for the restitution of property and plots of land throughout the
              city," which has upheaved the housing landscape in contemporary
              Warsaw.
            </b>
            Authorities have been accused of colluding with property developers
            to exploit loopholes in the system, and subsequently "undo the
            collective achievements of the city‚Äôs postwar reconstruction." While
            some view the complicated topic of reprivitization as righting
            historical wrongs, it has had serious negative effects on the city.
            Because reprivatization claims are based on land plots as they
            existed in pre-war Warsaw, they inaccurately align with post-war
            structures and spaces. As such, school playgrounds have been
            reprivatized and turned into "weed-laden car parks." Former public
            green spaces lie untended, and buildings remain empty and decaying
            due to uncertainty over their ownership. Additionally, claims to
            property are further complicated by the fact that they can be bought
            and sold on the open market, often resulting in swindling and fraud.
            <a href="#citations">[9]</a> <br /><br />
            <b>
              Those most affected by the reprivatization process are tenants of
              formerly city-owned buildings that have been transferred into
              private owners' hands.
            </b>
            Suddenly, "thousands of people living in rent-controlled properties
            are faced with private landlords that had little incentive or desire
            to keep them there." The problem is especially acute in central
            Warsaw, where the communist authorities concentrated social housing,
            but which has since become a prime location for trendy and luxury
            real estate. Consequently, the Polish housing crisis continues to
            grow. A two-person apartment to rent in Warsaw costs ~3,300z≈Ç (or
            $814.73) today, which is just shy of the monthly minimum wage of
            3,490z≈Ç ($861.64). In the last five years, rent has risen 58% in
            Warsaw. Attitudes of government officials and even many private
            citizens reflect anti-communist ideologies and often reject
            initiatives for social housing that harken back to Soviet Poland.<a

              Poland, once again, is in crisis and sitting on the geographical
              edge of war. Vulnerable people including both Polish citizens and
              international refugees have been left to fend for themselves and
              have often been forced into taking desperate measures, with many
              turning to squatting in derelict buildings.
            </b>
            <a href="#citations">[11]</a> Tenants advocating for their rights
            have been met with harassment, violence, and perhaps even death.
            This is the apparent case for Jolanta Brzeska, a tenant widely
            thought to have been killed by developers trying to remove her from
            her from her home after ownership was granted to three historical
            heirs and a notorious property claims dealer.
            <a href="#citations">[12]</a> Finally free from occupation, Poland
            has the opportunity to empower those living within its borders; the
            painful echoes reverberating from the calamitous housing landscape
            of World War II can, at last, be mitigated and the suffering of
            those afflicted may be honored.

          <h2>About This Project</h2>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            <b>
              This project is timely as this year is the 80th anniversary of The
              Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and it calls attention to the complicated
              and often unjust historic and modern landscape related to housing.
            </b>
            In "Cartographies of Catastrophe: Mapping World War II Destruction
            in Germany and Poland," Jerzy El≈ºanowski and Carmen M. Enss note
            that qualitative analyses of post-catastrophic-damage cartography
            constitute "a serious research gap in the field of urban history."
            <a href="#citations">[13]</a> This project aspires to help fill that
            gap in some capacity in addition to honoring the memories of those
            who have and those who continue to struggle with suffering
            associated with housing.

                gentrification in Greenpoint, a historically Polish ethnic
                enclave in Brooklyn.
              </b>
              In these assignments, I have noted the increase of luxury housing
              and decrease of cultural institutions in the neighborhood. For my
              final project, I chose to continue focusing on housing and the
              relationship between the past and present. However, I decided to
              turn my focus to Poland and to center on the site of the former
              The Warsaw Ghetto and its surrounding areas. <br /><br />

              I have geolocated historic photos of The Warsaw Ghetto and
              juxtapose them with views of contemporary sites of displacement,
              such as reprivatized blocks and luxury housing. Additionally, I
              have chosen to overlay a historic map onto the digital map as
              another means of combining past and present moments by unifying
              contemporary digital mapping with its traditional analog
              counterpart. Furthermore, I used MapLibre for it‚Äôs extrusion
              feature to display 3D buildings and contrasted that against the
              historic data.
