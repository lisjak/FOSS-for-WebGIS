        <p>
          Greenpoint is an epicenter of intense and uncontrolled gentrification
          that has left longtime residents and institutions scrambling for
          affordable housing. According to a study from NYU‚Äôs Furman Center for
          Real Estate and Urban Policy, the adjoining areas of Williamsburg and
          Greenpoint were the most rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods in the city
          between 1990 and 2014. To qualify as gentrified, a neighborhood must
          meet 2 criteria: (1) it must have been "low income" in 1990, meaning
          its household income was in the bottom 40 percent of the city‚Äôs
          neighborhoods; and (2) since 1990, the neighborhood‚Äôs rents had to
          have increased faster than the median rate of increase for the city.
          From 1990 to 2014, average rents citywide "went up about 22.1
          percent," while rent in Greenpoint "more than tripled that rate of
          increase, to 78.7 percent." This boom in gentrification was
          precipiated by a 2005 rezoning change that allowed for the
          construction of high-rise, luxury buildings in the area.
